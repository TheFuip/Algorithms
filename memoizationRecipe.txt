Steps for Memoization
1.) Make it work. Have a solution that is recursive.
    - visualize the problem as a tree.
    - see how you can take the larger problem and break it down into steps.
    - implement the tree using recursion.
    - test it

2.) Make it efficent.
    - add a memo object (usually hashmap speed equivalent data structure). with the keys as unique parameters and the values as recursive calls or vice-versa
    - add a base case to return memo values.
    - store return values into the memo.

3.)
